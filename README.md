# rvprec

This is a lookup routine for quickly estimating photon-limited RV precision given a pre-computed table of Q-factors and fluxes.

Based on [BT-Settl spectra](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/france.allard/).

To use, download and extract the [pre-computed tables](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zzqg6jol1h6xrez/q_info.zip?dl=0).

# Main functions
See 'get_hpf_rv_precision' and 'get_neid_rv_precision' in instprec.py

Note, need to open and edit directories there to reflect the q_file directory.
